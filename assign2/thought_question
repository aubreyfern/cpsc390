Is the algorithm A* with the last two functions? If yes, which of the two h
should produce the smallest search tree?

Yes, A* is with the last two functions because it uses the goal to find the
shortest distance. The euclidean should produce the smallest distance because
it takes the square root of the values and it the straight line distance.
