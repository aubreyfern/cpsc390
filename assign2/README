ABOUT:
At main program references input.cpp to take in user input and read in the file.
In input.cpp the file is read in and the grid is saved as a 2d Array. The amount of
rows and the 2d array is sent to the main and the main references the search algorithms.
The search algorithms take in the row amount and the 2d array.
In the search algorithms a copy of the array is made to later output the file path.
The initial and goal spots are found and the simulation begins.
The simulation checks the cardinal positions starting from the initial position.
It checks if the location exists on the board and then if it can be traversed(isopen).
It then checks if it has been in this location before.
If the smallest distance has not been set, the smallest distance is set with the first
distance calculated. This distance is compared with other distances are calculated.
The robot moves to the location with the smallest distance and loops through until
it reaches the goal.

The terminal outputs each search algorithms distance travelled and total nodes and
path it traversed.

output is sent to the output.out file.
